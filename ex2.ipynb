    "**Investigation 3.** The economist [Thomas Piketty argues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_in_the_Twenty-First_Century) that we have entered an age where the return on capital is greater than the growth due to income, and that this leads to higher inequality. We could incorporate income into the model by assigning each individual $i$ a per-timestep income $g_i$, where the $g_i$ are randomly chosen _a priori_. If there were no exchange, then wealth would grow linearly, and so the Gini coefficient would remain equal to `gini(g)`. Investigate what happens when we combine income, inflation, and random exchange. How well correlated are income and wealth? Do you agree with Piketty?"
